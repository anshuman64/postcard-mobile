    "body": "WARNING: long message ahead Hello friends. Today I feel compelled to share this because I feel like it is something many people go through but few talk about. Today after leaving a health professional panel I broke down in tears for both good and bad reasons. For starters, for the first time in my college career I went to a panel where there were health professionals of a similar background, that I could relate to (thank you AAP). In the past I have always felt slightly discouraged after hearing panels of med students who come from families with doctors, or college degrees, or other social and economic advantages that have navigated into med school with a lot more grace and ease than I can even fathom. Today's panel consisted of all Latinx first generation college students turned health professionals who were candid about their struggles and how they ultimately persevered. Throughout my college experience I have been very understanding and patient with myself but that is not to say I haven't put unnecessary amounts of stress and pressure on myself sometimes to do what I think will ultimately lead me to achieve my end goal. I know that I will succeed because of my determination and genuine passion for the medical field but that is not to say I do not go through bouts of insecurity and self deprecation. Many of my peers have often lauded me for my accomplishments in college and tell me how successful I am without knowing all of the academic shortcomings and failures I have experienced (and continue experiencing) that have led me to where I am today. I am not a genius, I do not succeed at everything, but I am a hard worker. I do things with heart and my sense of purpose goes beyond doing things for myself. Recently I have spread myself very thin, not always giving myself time to recharge or de-stress and it takes a toll, but everyday I am learning and evolving in order to help myself help others. At a school that puts so much emphasis on competition and peoples successes I feel that it is often forgotten that failures also play a pivotal role in our evolution as students and future professionals. I hope we can become more understanding with each other and ourselves in order to be happier and healthier as we navigate through such an amazingly wonderful yet stressful time in our lives. Yay for being human, yay for our failures, yay for achieving our goals. If you read this entire thing I appreciate you. K i'm done.",
